## 5. Detailed Requirements

### 5.1. Core Gameplay Mechanics

* **Rules Engine:** Must accurately implement all rules specified in "Oware Nam Nam: Rules, Gameplay, and Strategies" [cite: 1-55], including setup, sowing ('laps' rule [cite: 10-13]), capture conditions [cite: 15-19], turn structure, end-of-round condition (8 seeds [cite: 21]), territory gain [cite: 23-29], and game end condition [cite: 30].
* **Game Flow:**
    * Start Screen: Splash animation -> Sign-in/Guest option -> Main Menu.
    * Main Menu: Select Mode (vs AI for MVP), AI Difficulty, Start Game.
    * First Move Determination: Animated "pick a hand" sequence to determine who goes first.
    * Gameplay Screen: Display board, seeds, player scores, active turn indicator. Handle player input (selecting house to sow from). Execute AI moves.
    * End of Round: Calculate captures, display winner, animate territory change, present Mansa Musa trivia.
    * End of Game: Display winner with celebratory animation, then show scorecard (Houses Won, Houses Lost, Points Earned), present options (Play Another Round, Best Move Replay, Graduate to next level if applicable).
* **AI:** Implement 4 distinct difficulty levels (referred to as Levels I, II, III, and IV) with varying strategic capabilities. The AI opponent will be referred to as "the Elder" across all difficulty levels.
* **Scoring:** Implement the secondary scoring system based on AI level, displayed clearly to the player and saved for signed-in users.
* **Progression System:** Players start at Level I and can graduate to higher levels by winning the best of three successive games.
* **Seed Sowing Animation:** Implement semi-automatic, animated sowing with a translucent "hand of God" that scoops and sows seeds with appropriate physics and sound effects.
* **Interaction Controls:**
    * Tap to select a house for sowing seeds
    * Tap to capture available marbles
    * Tap to assign territory after winning a game
    * Tap to speed up sowing animation
    * Press-and-hold to double sowing animation speed
* **Visual Guidance:** Show pulsing rings of light around available houses (golden) and capturable marbles (green) at the first two difficulty levels.
* **Best Move Replay:** Record and allow replay of the game's most points-rewarding move.
* **Captured Seeds Display:** Show a running tally of captured seeds with an animated burlap sack visual.
* **Game Controls:**
    * Start Over option available at any time
    * User Menu with profile information and statistics
    * "How to Play" help panel with game rules and points system explanation

### 5.2. Visuals & User Interface (UI)

* **3D Assets:** Create high-quality 3D models for the board, seeds, table, rug, and environment elements according to the specified art style (Pixar-inspired) and material descriptions (ivory, gold, stone, walnut, zebra hide). Reference image `docs/references/M'Oware Board.png` to guide board design.
* **Environment:** Develop the University of Sankore event hall setting with appropriate lighting (diffuse, natural) and shallow depth-of-field effect.
* **Animations:** Implement all required gameplay animations smoothly and clearly:
    * "Hand of God" seed sowing animation with cupping and tilting motions
    * Seed dropping with physical reverberations and settling effects
    * "Pick a hand" animation for first move determination
    * Capture effects with satisfying visual feedback (glow, particle effects)
    * Territory change visuals with color shift and ownership indicators
    * UI transitions with smooth easing functions

    * Green pulsing rings around capturable marbles (Levels I and II only)
    * Solid golden rings around owned territory during territory assignment
    * Green pulsing rings around available territories during assignment
* **Layout Orientation:** Implement landscape orientation as the default/native layout for all platforms, particularly considering the horizontal nature of the Oware game board. The UI should be optimized for landscape view on both desktop and mobile devices. For mobile and tablet-sized devices in portrait mode, display an animated visual/iconographic indicator prompting users to rotate their device for the optimal gaming experience.
* **Responsiveness:** Ensure the UI layout and 3D view adapt gracefully to different screen sizes (desktop monitors, tablets, smartphones). Touch controls must be intuitive on mobile with appropriate hit areas (minimum 44x44 pixels).
* **UI Elements:** Design clean and intuitive buttons, menus, score displays, trivia interface, and sign-in prompts consistent with the overall art style. Use clear iconography with text labels where appropriate.
* **Additional UI Components:**
    * Start Over icon in the upper right corner
    * User Menu icon with profile picture, screen name, difficulty level, PPG, and recent scorecards
    * "How to Play" help panel with game rules and points system explanation

* **API:** Develop backend API endpoints for:
    * User registration/login.
    * Saving player scores associated with user ID.
    * (Post-MVP) Saving/loading game state.
    * (Post-MVP) Handling IAP entitlements.
* **Database:** Select and configure a suitable database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MongoDB) to store user account information and scores.
